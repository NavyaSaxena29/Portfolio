                                I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer & Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in machine learning, AI, and software systems. Before this, I worked as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase for 2 years, where I developed AI-powered solutions for document management, including a deep learning model for extracting handwritten text from loan agreements. I also built full-stack web applications and optimized machine learning models. Alongside my academic journey, I mentor K-12 students through the FIFE-Penn CS Academy and am actively involved in developing new projects. I am eager to explore impactful opportunities in software engineering, machine learning, NLP, and data-driven solutions.

                                I have always been passionate about coding and problem-solving, which drives me to
                                continuously explore new technologies and develop innovative solutions. From building
                                AI-powered applications to optimizing large-scale data systems, I enjoy tackling complex
                                challenges that push the boundaries of software development. I find excitement in
                                writing efficient algorithms, designing scalable architectures, and leveraging machine
                                learning to extract meaningful insights from data. Beyond technical skills, I am deeply
                                invested in mentoring and sharing my knowledge, helping others grow in the field. My
                                enthusiasm for coding extends beyond workâ€”I actively contribute to projects, engage in
                                research, and stay updated with emerging trends in AI and software engineering.

                                I have a broad technical skill set spanning multiple domains. In programming, I am
                                proficient in C++, C, Python, Java, and R. My experience with databases includes SQL,
                                PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and OracleDB. In web development, I have worked with HTML, CSS,
                                JavaScript, React, Node.js, Angular, TypeScript, Spring Boot, and REST APIs to build
                                scalable and dynamic applications. For AI and machine learning, I have hands-on
                                experience with techniques like linear regression, clustering, and classification, using
                                tools such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
                                Additionally, in Natural Language Processing, I have worked with GenAI, OpenAI API, LLM,
                                RAG, LangChain, Hugging Face, Transformers, and LLAMA. I also utilize tools like Git,
                                GitHub, Jira, Splunk, Jenkins, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, and Jupyter to manage code,
                                automate workflows, and optimize development processes.
